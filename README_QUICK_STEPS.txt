Quick steps to get live (iPad-friendly):

1) Upload this repo to GitHub:
   - On GitHub.com create new repo 'autoconnectorsapp'
   - Use 'Upload files' and upload all files from this zip (or use desktop to push)

2) In Vercel:
   - Import new GitHub repo
   - Set environment variables from .env.local.example
   - Deploy

3) In Firebase:
   - Create project, add web app, copy config into .env.local
   - Deploy functions with Firebase CLI (requires a computer) or use console to paste functions code.

If you want I can give step-by-step taps for GitHub upload using iPad — say 'iPad upload steps' and I'll give them.
